## Using Fleasion
- Download the latest release and  extract the files from the zip file.
- Run `run.bat` to start the program, this will automatically ensure you have the correct version of python downloaded 
as well as install any dependencies.
- The Fleasion script will then run, follow the prompts given.

### Loading Texures
Fleasion requires you to load textures/audio before you can use them. As such you may be directed to join [Texture Game](https://www.roblox.com/games/18504289170/Texture-Game)
and Phantom Forces on Launch to load them. Some files require you to do certain things to load the defaults:
- Sights (Equip the sight on a gun)
- Skins (Equip the skin on a gun / Load the skin's preview in the case shop)
- Skyboxes (Load the skyboxes by playing on maps with the corresponding skyboxes)
- Remove Textures (Load the textures by playing on maps with the textures you want to remove)

If you are unsure of why a texture isn't loading, see [Help & Support](#help--support).

## Features

- **Replacement of textures/audios**
- **Blocking:** Highly experimental. Requires running `run.bat` as admin to access. It is volatile and can break your game.
Use only if you know what you're doing.
- **Presets:** Allows you to save multiple replacements to be used in bulk.
- **Clear Cache:** Used to clear any replacements. It will reset everything you have done.

### Bloxstrap Compatibility
For some Fleasion features such as force default skyboxes, it is recommended to be used alongside Bloxstrap. Bloxstrap 
custom skyboxes only work on maps with default skyboxes, so using Fleasion to force default skyboxes allows custom Bloxstrap 
skyboxes to be used on any map.

## Hashes
All of the hashes used to replace textures/audio are stored internally in `assets.json`, and are updated regularly with new additions.
For a more human readable dump of some of the hashes, see this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S7GexRGkgiDXit8qabV7rYFOctO6FraZrrTm1-Rru_4/edit?usp=sharing) compiled by `@yoloblokers` and `@.commit.`.
